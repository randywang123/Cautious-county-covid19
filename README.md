# Cautious-county-covid19
# Business Question 
- Which Counties Should be Most Cautious as the COVID-19 Pandemic spread across the US?
- Many counties are suffering from the pandemic since its outbreak. The main idea of this project is to find out which counties are suffering the most from the pandemic, so they can take some measures in dealing with the tough situation. 

# Data interpretation
- Data analysis packages:  `pandas`, `numpy`
- Data visualization package: `plotly`
- Issues about the installation is that we have to run `conda install jupyter` in order to make the plotly work in the local jupyter notebook 

# Data Visualization
- Please check the notebook for more details 

# Conclusion 
As we can see from the heatmap, the death and confirmed cases have higher correlation to the senior citizens (over 60 years old) with z score around 0.55, which is 0.1 higher than the correlation of teenagers (less than 18 years old). So we can can make a conclusion that those counties with more senior citizens would have to be cautious to the new coronavirus outbreak and should prepare enough medical resources to help the public get over the hard time. Some counties like LA County, Cook County, Harris County and San Diego County would have to pay more attention to the prevention of the spread of the pandemic becuase they have more senior citizens. Also, the shortage of the hospital bed would have slightly less correlation 0.47 to the death and confirmed cases but would also play a role in those areas. For example, Randall County, Washington County, Monroe County, Polk County would have to be cautious to the virus.
